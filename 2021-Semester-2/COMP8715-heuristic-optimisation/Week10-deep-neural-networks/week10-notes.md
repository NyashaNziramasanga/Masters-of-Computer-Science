- Each layer in a neural network extracts different type of information
- There are many hidden layers which increases the parameter space
- feature engineering, detecting the features in computer vision
- More data has lead to the rise of DNN this includes GPU accelerated computation
- DNN performed automatic feature extraction without human intervention
