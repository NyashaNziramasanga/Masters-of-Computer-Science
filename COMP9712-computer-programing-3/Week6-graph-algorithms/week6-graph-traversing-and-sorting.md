# Week 6 Traversing and Sorting

## Graph-Traversal Algorithms

Traversing or Searching a graph is systematically following the edges of a graph to visit the vertices of the graph, which is used to discover the structure of a graph.

Standard graph-traversal/search algorithms are:

- **Breadth First Search (BFS)** - layers from the root

- **Depth First Search (DFS)** - As deep as you can from the root

## Uses of Graph Traversal

- **Reachability** - Is Vertex B is reachable from vertex A if there is a path from A to B
- **Connectedness** - An undirected graph is connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex
