### Single-Source Shortest-Path

- The problem of finding the shortest path in the graph from vertex X (the source vertex) to all other vertices
- All problems corresponding to finding a route, dispatching something as quickly as possible
- e.g.Messages in a network or Travel by car
- We talk about the sum of weights on all the edges in the path not the number of edges
