## HashMap or TreeMap

### HashMap

- A data structure that passes values through a hash function and stores the values on a hash table
- Has a complexity of `O (1)` if there are no collisions (if there are collisions complexity is `O (n)`) good for `lookup`

### TreeMap

- A data structure that uses a tree structure to store data
- Has a complexity of `O(log n)` if tree is balanced and is good for `ordering` data e.g. alphabetically etc

### Binary Search Tree

- Data stored in a tree structure
- Node contain keys and links to associated values
- Basic operation is `O(log n)` for n keys only if tree is balanced, if not performance degrades to `O(n)`
- Example `TreeMap` in Java

#### Example:

look for `rune`, everything is ordered alphabetically. Go through each node comparing `r`

### Hashing

- Uses array to store data values
- Uses a **hash function** that works out where to look for the stored value in the array based on a key
- **Hash function** is a mathematical calculation that operates on a values key and produces an int value which is now the index/position in the array which is a `O (1)` lookup

#### Handling collisions

1. Separate Chaining
2. Open Addressing :
   Find another place for the value in the array after a collision:

- Linear probing - just try the next available slot
- Double hashing - hash again to find an offset from the original
  position

### String.hashCode() in Java

```java
public int hashCode() {
  int h = hash;
  int len = count;
  if (h == 0 && len > 0) {
    int off = offset;
    char val[] = value;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      h = 31*h + val[off++];
    }
    hash = h;
  }
  return h;
}
```

## Trie Data Structure

- Designed for information retrieval
- Designed to conserve space
- Allow fast lookups
- Uses natural words have a large amount of overlap
- **Stores characters in each node**, not whole words
- Tree structure

#### Example

Insert the following words `glow, glide, ham, great`

### Trie Compaction

- Saving space by compacting the trie
- Tree nodes are relatively expensive in terms of space
- â€¢ Merge subpaths in the tree where there is only one option
  (i.e. sequences of nodes that each have only one child)

#### Example

Insert the following words `grow, green, greater, greatest, glow, glide, ham, great` in a compact trie
