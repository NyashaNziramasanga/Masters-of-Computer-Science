Work out all the shortest paths in the graph, from any
point to any other point

## Algorithm Idea

- Order all the vertices in a particular (arbitrary) order

## Track the paths

## Route Planning

- Planning the best route from A to B
- GPS, Google, Bing and others need to:
  - Exact shortest path in a large road network
  - Fast Queries
  - Fast Processing
  - Low space consumption

### Improvements to Dijkstra:

- Bidirectional Search
- Data Structures (Priority Queues)
- Goal-Directed Search
- Precomputed Cluster Distances
- Highway Hierarchies

#### Bidirectional Search

- Dijkstra gives paths from one source to all destinations
- If source and destination is know, Start Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm at both ends (at source and at
  destination), and run them simultaneously
- When the two paths link up, this is the shortest path

- Generally speeds up searching by a factor of more than 2

#### Data Structures (Priority Queues)

- Using a priority queue data structure leads to a complexity of `O (log n)`

#### Goal-Directed Search

#### Precomputed Cluster Distances

#### Highway Hierarchies
