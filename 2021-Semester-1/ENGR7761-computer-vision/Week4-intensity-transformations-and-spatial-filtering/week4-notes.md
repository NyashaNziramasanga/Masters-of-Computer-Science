# Week4 Intensity Transformations and Spatial Filtering

## 3.1 Intensity Transformations 

- Spatial domain processes are based on `g(x,y) = T[f(x,y)]`
- `f(x,y)` input image
- `g(x,y)` output image

Point wise methods:

- **Contrast stretching**, produces an image with higher contrast
- **Thresholding**, produces a binary image

Contrast is black as it is easier for the human eyes to identify a potential cancer cell

### Gamma Correction

Darker parts are much more pronounced

### Intensity Slicing

Highlight a portion of the pixels/image and reduce everything else to show what you are interested in
