# Week 2 Image Processing

## Digital image

- A digital image is a matrix using a 2d function (x,y )
- finite and discrete quantities
- Composed of a finite number of elements i.e. pixels

### Difference with computer vision vs image processing

- No clear boundary
- the end user of computer vision is a machine whilst for image processing it a human
- Consider the following:
  - Low-level: noise reduction, contrast enhancement, image sharpening
  - Mid-level: segmentation, classification of individual objects
