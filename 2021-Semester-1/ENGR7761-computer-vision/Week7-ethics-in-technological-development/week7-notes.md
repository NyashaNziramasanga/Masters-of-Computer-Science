# Week 7 Ethics in Technological Development

- **Ethics**, is the study of how to decide if something is morally right or wrong
- **Consequentialism**, focuses on the consequences of an act on the whole good or bad outcomes
- **Utilitarianism**, looking at the overall good for the stakeholders weighted by the probability and impact

## Techniques:

- **Dialectics**, exploring the issue from both sides
- **Analogy**, compare between different cases/situations
- **Deontology**, study of duty and obligations of the actor, in terms of what the actor should do, can do and prohibited to do

## Paramedic ethics for technology

- a paramedic knows a little and know when to ask for help.

### Paramedic ethics method:

1. Identify the stakeholders
2. Identify benefits and costs (utilitarian step)
3. COnsider duties, responsibilities, prohibitions and obligations (Deontology step)
4. Are there any analogies (reasoning by analogy)
5. Make a decision (reflective equilibrium)

## Bias in Machine Learning

Machine learning finds patterns within data, the bias arises from the training set which can create a feedback loop
