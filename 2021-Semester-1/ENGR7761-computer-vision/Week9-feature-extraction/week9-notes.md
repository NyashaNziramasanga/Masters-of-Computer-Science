# Week 9 Feature Extraction

- Feature extraction is finding features in a n image, region, boundary
- feature descriptions, assign quantitative and qualitative attributes
- Features are ideally independent of location, rotation and scale
- Uses a boundary following algorithm

## Algorithm

### 1. Moore boundary following algorithm

Traces the boundary of a 1-valued region, R, in a binary image

### 2. Freeman Chain Code

### 3. Boundary approximations using minimum perimeter polygons
