# Week 7 Risk Management

## Validation/Verification

- Validating that the design of the product works
- Validate the design does not fail
- Use Failure modes to identify issues and mitigating them

### First level

Use hand calculations such as analysis, excel etc to validate the design

### Optimisation level

- Use a simulation
- Stress and fatigue analysis
- Control simulations
- Feedback to design before testing

## Questions

- What are you going to test?
- Testing for normal usage? or abnormal usage?
- How long should the product last ?

## Design Validation Plan and Report
