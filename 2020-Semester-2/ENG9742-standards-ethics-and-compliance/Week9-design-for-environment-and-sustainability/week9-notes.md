# Week9 Design for environment and sustainability

## 1. Design for Sustainability

- Seeking to meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future generations
- Envisions enduring prosperity of all living things
- "sustainability can be an effective driver for higher levels of innovation"(Corder,2015)
- Focus is on driving sustainable design

- The Five Capitals Sustainability Model
  - Natural Capital
    - How can we use renewable energy
    - eg energy reduction
  - Human Capital
    - How can w leverage local skills
    - eg local employment
  - Social Capital
    - What can be done with the local lifestyle
    - eg community programs
  - Manufactured Capital
    - How can they be more efficient
    - eg shared use of infrastructure
  - Financial Capital eg account for environmental

## 2. Design for Producability

- Using materials that are recyclable and use low amounts of energy to produce
- Environmental processing and manufacturing:
  - Lower energy materials
  - Lower energy processes
  - Fewer process steps
  - Net shape parts
- Design for low energy usage, or energy efficiency - energy start

## 3. Design for Manufacturing

- Number one DFM issue: tolerances
- Number two issue is material selection because it drives the processes
- Reducing the number of parts in a product is probably the best opportunity for reducing manufacturing costs
- Use lower energy in the process (Lower temperatures, fewer processing, net shape parts)

## Design for Assembly

- Designing the system to be easily, inexpensive and ergonomic to assemble
- Less time, less human input, lower scrap and less energy used

## Design for Maintainability and Repair

- Ensure that the design will perform satisfactorily throughout its intended life with minimum expenditure of budget and effort
- Example using Welding over fastening, rivets over screws
- Minimize:
  - Downtime for maintenance
  - User and technician maintenance time
  - Personnel injury in process
  - Costs from maintenance
