## Observations

Projects always start with observations

- Patterns
- Variety and scale
- Widespread/Local
- Short-term/ long-term

Observations are made to:

- Prove th existence of a pattern/phenomena
- Corroborate models, theories or explanations
- Represent reality, get a better understanding of the subject to be studied

## Develop Models, Theories and Hypotheses

Models or theories explaining the observation are based on:

- Environmental constraints
- Competition
- Behaviors
- Predation
- Reproduction
- Disease
- Anthropogenic impact
