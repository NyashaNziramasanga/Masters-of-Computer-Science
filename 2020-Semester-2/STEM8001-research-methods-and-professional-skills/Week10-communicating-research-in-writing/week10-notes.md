# Week10-communicating-research-in-writing

## Why do Scientists write

- Share their results
  - With other scientists
  - With industry
  - With government
  - With the public
- Get funding for more research

## How do Scientists write

- Share their results
  - With other scientists Journal articles,conference papers, emails
  - With industry Journal articles/professional communications, emails
  - With government Reports
  - With the public Media release
- Get funding for more research
  - Impact statements/Grant applications

## Why should you write

- Reveal your understanding for a topic
- Sharing scientific findings and discoveries

## Proposals

- Research Proposal
  - A document used to present and justify the need to study a research problem.
- Grant Proposal
  - Similar to a research proposal but also includes an extensive budget section.

## What is a Research Proposal

- Document used to present and justify the need to study a research problem
- Aims to convince the reader to support the project

## Why write a Research Proposal

- To propose a research project that will result in a significant contribution to knowledge
- To formulate a detailed plan of the project including methodological approach and theoretical framework.
- To ensure that the proposed research is achievable within the required time and with the available resources.
- To demonstrate that you have adequate expertise and experience to undertake the project.

## Skills Developed

- Subject knowledge and research skills
- Critical thinking skills  
- Communication skills

## How to structure a Research Proposal

- Introduction, background to the topic, significance and research problem
- Research aims and questions
- Review of literature
- Methodology
- Timeline, how long research will take
- Expected outcomes/impact
- References
  
### Introduction

- Define the topic well
- Hypothesis should be clear and testable, not overly simplistic
- Make sure the research is novel
- Be realistic, have an achievable goal 

### Research Aims

- Relevant
- Important
- Clear
- Precise 
- Researchable

### Methodology

- Approach or philosophy of your research
- Step by step process used to undertake the research

#### Main points

- What kind of data or sources will you use (Quantitative or qualitative)
- How you will collect and manage the material
- Theoretical and methodological techniques will use to interpret and analyse these data/sources
- Discuss possible problems and how these will be overcome

â€¢ Ask yourself these questions:
- What is your research problem?
- What are the specific research goals or questions that you will need to address in order to investigate this problem?
- What kind of data or sources will best allow you to reach these goals?
- How will you gather your data/sources/information? How will you gain access to them? Will you need to generate your own data by conducting surveys or experiments?
- What method or methods of interpretation and analysis is most suitable for your project? Will your study be qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-method?
- What theories underlie your research? How will these theories allow you to meet your research goals?
- Are there any ethical implications of your data collection or method of analysis?

### Language

- Formal
  - Scientific, impersonal, objective
- Highly structured
  - Titles, sub-headings, sections
- Specificity and breadth
  - Detailed enough for experts, but general enough for novice.
