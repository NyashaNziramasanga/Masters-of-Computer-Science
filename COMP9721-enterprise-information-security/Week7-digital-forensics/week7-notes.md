Forensic computing - tracking and recovery of data in computer systems. Applications of digital forensics are :

- Law enforcement and detection
- Data recovery
- Digital preservation
- Problem tracking

Rigorous methodical approach is needed to explain how it occurred ?, what occurred? and why it occurred ?

## Digital Forensics Fundamentals

- Preservation - data/hardware is preserved and not tampered with
- Identification - cataloguing data of interest
- Extraction - retrieving the useful elements for appropriate analysis
- Documentation - Have accompanying documentation
- Interpretation - the findings of the investigation

**Data Recovery** attempt to reconstruct file entries if indexes are lost

Problem diagnosis's:

- Identifying the operating environment
- Noting the applications being used
- Observing operator actions
