## Communication Security

- Concerns the networked environment of
  your Enterprise, and the access to and use of its
  (Information) Assets
- Protection of data being transmitted over a network

### Considerations

- Things that can be done to minimise attacks on systems
- What to do when there is a breach

> Principle of less privilege - Only connect essential services that must be connected to the outside world

## Firewalls

- All internet traffic from outside to inside passes through a firewall
- Security policy defines authorised internet traffic allowed to pass
- Comprises of **packet filtering** and **application gateway**

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

- Performs header and deep packet inspection
- Comprises of IDS and **intrusion prevention systems**
- **Detection** - Inspect and identify malicious or suspicious packets and trigger an alert, **Deep-packet** inspection looks at data content of packets
- **Prevention** - filtering of the identified traffic (packets)
