# Cloud Computing 3 - Cloud Architecture

Cloud computing is required to meet the requirement of **scalability**,**cost efficiency**, **legal agreement** & **business**

## Architecture for Elasticity (Scale)

- Vertical Scale-Up - Adding more power e.g. adding more CPU, RAM etc
- Horizontal Scale Out - Adding more machines e.g. distributed databases

## [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cloud Computing Reference Architecture](https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-cloud-computing-reference-architecture)

- On demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

**Cloud Service Orchestration** - Composition of system components to support Cloud
Providers activities in arrangement, coordination and management of computing resources in order to provide cloud services to Cloud Consumers
