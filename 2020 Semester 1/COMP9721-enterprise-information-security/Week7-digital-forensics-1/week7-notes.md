Forensic computing - tracking and recovery of data in computer systems. Applications of digital forensics are :

- Law enforcement and detection
- Data recovery
- Digital preservation
- Problem tracking

Rigorous methodical approach is needed to explain how it occurred ?, what occurred? and why it occurred ?

## Digital Forensics Fundamentals

- Preservation - data/hardware is preserved and not tampered with
- Identification - cataloguing data of interest
- Extraction - retrieving the useful elements for appropriate analysis
- Documentation - Have accompanying documentation
- Interpretation - the findings of the investigation

**Data Recovery** attempt to reconstruct file entries if indexes are lost

Problem diagnosis's:

- Identifying the operating environment
- Noting the applications being used
- Observing operator actions

## Tools and Methods for DF

### Network Analysers

- Packet sniffers
- Trace-route
- Signal analysis
- Intrusion detection

### Data Analysers

- Hex dump lister/analyser
- Disk grabbers
- Disk direct accessors – by sector, byte rather than via file systems
- File analysers – block by block

### Investigative Analysis

- Hot spot detection – look for the obvious
- Searching – look for the hidden
- Think like a criminal – how might actions be concealed, where might inappropriate material be stored
- Pattern detection
- Explore file attributes (File sizes, last accessed, last modified, logging, frequency of access)

## Issues with forensics

Forensic computing is a victim of technological
change

- Increased power and speed of computers
  - Helps the forensic people to do their work more quickly
  - Helps the ‘bad guys’ to do their work more effectively
- Massive increase in storage capacities
  - Much more data for the forensics people to trawl through
- Vast array of device technologies
  - Digital everything – portable devices, cameras, phones
- Increased communication capabilities
  - Tracking and tracing of messaging and data more difficult

## Common forensic practices

- **Identification of Need** - When to initiate a forensics investigation ? when theres dta loss, equipment failure, suspicious events etc
- **Isolation of equipment**
- **Preservation of data and equipment state**
- **Inspection**
- **Investigation and Analysis**
- **Documentation** - What was done, when was it done, what was found
- **Outcome Report**
